[![Compile MuxTO status](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-megaavr/actions/workflows/compile-muxto.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-megaavr/actions/workflows/compile-muxto.yml)

This repository contains the source code and configuration files of the Arduino Core
for Microchip's ATMEGA4809 processor (used on the Arduino Uno WiFi Rev2 boards).

## Installation on Arduino IDE

This core is available as a package in the Arduino IDE cores manager.
Just open the "Boards Manager" and install the package called:

"Arduino megaAVR Boards"

## Support

There is a dedicated section of the Arduino [Forum for general discussion and project assistance](http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?board=126.0).
